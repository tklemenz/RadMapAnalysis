/// This class represents a track in the module.
/// Ideally a track consists of 4 clusters, one in each layer.
///
/// The idea at the moment is to give a set of clusters to the tracker who then puts the proper
/// clusters together and creates a temporary instance of Track and copies it to the Track vector
/// member of the Tracker class. 
/// --> only the Track constructor which gets the clusterVec and ParticleType is for now
///     intended to be used. Therefore, addCluster and setType are still there if needed
///     but made private to prevent usage outside of the class.
///
/// ParticleType of the track is not so important for us but if we want to have it
/// we need to think about how to set the proper type. In general it is possible to
/// have pions in the proton data! Otherwise it would be easy since we know which
/// particles we expect in every run. For now I would set unknown by default.
/// @todo Think about more info to be added to the track. E.g. angles, position (could be x-y in layer 1+2 and layer 3+4 separately)
